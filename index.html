            <h3>Welcome to Scooby's site</h3>
            <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Rodrigo Bunag III</span></h1>
            <h2>Hi, I am a Gamer!</h2>
            <p>I'm someone who values both the thrill of competition and the comfort of nostalgia. When it comes to spending time with friends, you'll often find me immersed in lively gaming sessions, where we laugh, strategize, and bond over shared victories and defeats. Whether it's conquering virtual worlds together or testing our skills in friendly competition, gaming provides the perfect backdrop for building lasting friendships.
               But it's not all about the digital realm for me. I also have a soft spot for the timeless charm of Scooby-Doo. There's just something special about joining Scooby and the gang on their mysterious adventures, unraveling puzzles, and sharing in their laughter along the way. It's a nostalgic escape that never fails to bring a smile to my face.
                In essence, I'm someone who cherishes both the excitement of gaming with friends and the comforting familiarity of classic entertainment like Scooby-Doo. Balancing these passions allows me to enjoy the best of both worlds, creating memories that are as thrilling as they are nostalgic.</p>
